For this reason, his life is regarded as a saint of love that no one can imitate. The theory of Pumba has been passed down in various forms. Each theory of Pumba has been passed down as an onomatopoeic word that has a kind of rhythm and phrase used in the chorus of Taryeong. The Eumseong Pumba Festival combines the spirit of philanthropy of Grandfather Choi Gwi-dong with Pumba, which has been solidified like the epitome of traditional Jangdolbaengi. Even if our lives in the modern world are enriched, mental poverty and inequality still exist. The festival was born with the proposition of 'We must experience catharsis through satire and humor and heal it with love and sharing'.
